## Problem ## 

A couple of years ago, I was interviewed by Google. Google asked about Big-O
complexity. I fumbled and failed through the questions. I never heard from Google again.
I figured I would get to that data structures stuff after I learn something more
useful...like Arduino!

About 5 months ago, I was interviewed by Facebook. Facebook asked about Big-O
complexity. I fumble and failed through the questions. Mark Zuckerberg called me
and said I was a failure and needed to go back to internet school. 

This had to change.

## Solution ## 

Google, Facebook, and any company -- startup or otherwise --
seeking the best of the best is going to look for
knowledge of data structures and algorithms. It was time for me to get with the
program. 

To the internets!! 

I found thousands of articles I didn't care to read. I
grabbed a couple of books on the kindle and they were great, but didn't give me the knowledge
I sought. After reading a blog about MOOCs, I took a new approach: I would try out
Coursera.

From the blog article I was reading, I decided that I would start my re-education
process. I would relearn
all of hard-core computer knowledge I had lost in the past 1.5 decades.

I signed up for [Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/algo). This was 6 weeks ago.

-- SMASH CUT --

Today, I took the final exam for [Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/algo) course on
coursera. 

As fate would have it, what determines whether I get the Certificate of
Accomplishment (70+ points) is turning in the last programming assignment for
half credit. Interesingly enough, this is kind of how I went through college, some 15
years ago. _"You actually want me to complete all my assignments? All of them?!?...fine, dude.
Whatever"_

Let me start of by saying that Tim Roughgarden is a great video lecturer. He
does a great job explaining the subject matter in basic terms. The problem for
guys like me -- who lack the steel trap brain -- is that if you have been away from
probability, statistics and the like, you may need a further refresher course at the high school level.

I told my colleagues that this course is "How to Rock a Tech Interview, for Dummies." 

I recently interviewed for engineer positions at three of Chicago's best
Ruby shops. I did well enough to receive offers from each firm. I am grateful and
flattered. 

  Demand of senior engineers aside, being able to speak with confidence about the asymptotic complexity of
algorithms and data structures added a deeper level to the interviews and code discussions. Instead of
waiting for the interviewer to ask "whats the worst-case..." I was confident -- on
account of this course -- to discuss divide and conquer algorithms and
data structures right off the bat. 
  Showing off, or rather, practicing my newly attained knowledge, I gave 4 different
answers for one of an interviewers questions. Provided with each answer was a different data
structure, its complexity, and its pros and cons. While the interviewer may
have thought I was a jackass, which I am, I believe I thoroughly demonstrated my knowledge
of the subject matter. This is thanks to Tim Roughgarden and the course.

This type of knowledge tends to be use it or lose it for me. By no fault but my
own, programming in Ruby has made me lazy. Or maybe just being lazy made me
lazy. Not having to "care" about speed, and simply defering to #sort has made me
lazy. Lazy. For my SaaS projects, I haven't needed to use data structures and
algorithms.  As I "move forward" in my Go journey and use Go more often, I am hoping
that I will be more open to using the appropriate tool for the job.
Gone are the days of arrays, hashes, and quicksort for everything!

## Conclusion ## 

My experience with Coursera has begun with a bang. I highly recommend Tim
Roughgardens course, for fun, knowledge, but definitely if you are looking to
switch jobs in the next 3-5 months ;)  
  I look forward to the next course I am taking: [The Hardware/Software
Interface](https://www.coursera.org/course/hwswinterface), which will re-learn
me that assembly, that I did back in the 90s. Wannabe-Future Crew forever!

Jeah!
