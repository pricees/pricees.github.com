## Why? ##

A few months ago I joined <a href="http://macournoyer.com/">Marc-Andr√©
Cournoyer</a>'s <a href="http://www.greatcodeclub.com/">Great Code Club</a>.
I will right my own blog post about this club, but let me say that t $30, its
well worth it to expand my programming life past Saas sites, exercism and Euler
projects.
Where was I? 
The second project from the Great Code Club is a transpiler, creating a css
parser from scratch. Far out right? Well I bobbled through M-A's use of <a
href="http://zaach.github.io/jison/">Jison</a>. At this stage of my career, I
can pick up this stuff pretty fast. But for me its always: can I get a deeper
understanding? Can I learn more? And in the world of computers, the answer is
always an emphatic __YES!!!!__.

Javascript and Go are the languages I am learning now. Ruby is the language I am
currently most fluent in. I looked at <a
href="https://github.com/tenderlove/racc">RACC</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/tenderlove/rexical">Rexical</a>, both developed by
Tenderlove. The documentation on these tools is parse. I couldn't find any good
information on them.

So, I says: "looks like its time to go back to grand-daddy C." I begin looking at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">Bison</a> (gnu's YACC). 
There is some documentation. Its going to be an interesting journey.

In the next series of posts, I hope to illuminate you to the world of compiler
compilers, grammars, lexers, and parsers.

We will start this adventure looking a Bison and Flex, move on to RACC and
Rexical, then onto Jison and Jisonlex, and possibly look at Go's YACC tools.

Grab your helmet, its going to be a bumpy ride.
