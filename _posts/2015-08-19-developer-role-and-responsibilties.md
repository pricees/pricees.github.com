# Developer #

## Role ##

Developers are responsible for implementing software to achieve the business needs and goals of the project set forth by project stakeholders. Developers, with guidance from team leads, managers and architects, fill in the gaps between business requests and software implementation, including design, modeling, and analysis. Developers are expected to work in a dynamic and fast paced environment. Developers may code individually, in pairs, or collaborate with arbitrary members of a team.

Developers are expected to communicate clearly and efficiently with their manager and product stakeholder. Developers should be vigilant about obstacles that will impede reaching their development goals, both in quality and timeliness as agreed upon with the stakeholder. Developers are expected to communicate and revise expectations as obstacles come up; they are expected to raise any problem up through the management chain until these problem is given the attention it needs and/or is resolved.

## Responsibilities ##

- Evaluate, assess and recommend software solutions
