For my first blog entry "[Check Inputs, Git Money]({% post_url 2013-05-24-custom-stripe-check %})," I used the Pomodoro Technique.  I used this Chrome Extension for [Strict Pomodoro](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/strict-workflow/cgmnfnmlficgeijcalkgnnkigkefkbhd?hl=en "the real deal").

I really enjoyed the first experience.  I did have to add [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) and [Gmail](http://mail.google.com) to my blacklist because they were such an easy distraction.

Overall, I give the experience two thumbs up.

I will definitely try it again.  Right now!
