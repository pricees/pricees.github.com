# The Problem #

Look, I am going to level with you.  When I start learning a general purpose
language in the shell, the first thing I do is look at how to create a "Hello

every-thing-but-the-kitchen-sink web framework, I look at how to create a
blogging app.  When I hear that a web framework is thin, and "lightweight" I
look at how to write a url shortener.  These are the starting points when I am
learning how to write in new languages.  So when I heard about this new playa on
tha block, Beego, and when I heard him calling himself "Sinatra-inspired," I was
