The Challenge
: This is the programmer who is always looking to push the limits of his or her
own ability. This doesn't mean create the same things a new language. This means
creating a brand new thing that may involve creating a new language. This means
taking the accomplishments of the developer and saying "can you do that with
100x the action with half the resources." This means "going to the moon",
"breaking this most sophisticated cryptography", this means sprinting to the peak
of most everest.. .. in business.

The Lottery Ticket
: This programmer is looking for a company that is going to make him or her
rich. He may be lazy, in a good way, or may see to fund his Elon Musk-esque
ideas. Either way, he is looking to get rich or die tryin.

The Stability
: You know that guy, Johnny punchclock. He has a family, kids, and better things
to do then stay late or bust his hump over the weekend. This doesn't mean he's
lazy, he's just done chasing the dollar. He has a quality of life that he seeks
to keep, and his job is just that. Long gone are the billionaire dreams. This
isn't a bad thing at all.

The Culture
: This person is looking for a place where work doesn't seem like work. I am not
saying she won't get work done. This programmer wants a place that is cool, fun,
and a luxury to work for. Think Zappos, Google, etc. Where you never need to
leave the workplace, and you may never want to.

The Topgun
: This programmer wants to hang with her buddies, the elite of the elite. These
programmers no the ins and outs of languages. She knows Javascript, C, and won't
hesitate to throw down some Assembly just for funzies. She knows the inside and
out of the linux kernel, big O notation, and the handshakes of any number of
different protocols. She wants to be with the best.

The New Shit
: This programmer wants to be using the bleeding edge tools. If its not MariaDB,
its MongoDB, if its not Mongo its Hadoop, Neo4J, Redis, Cassandra. Are we
talking Elixir, Go, Node, D, who cares, its just gotta be fresh. Programming in
an established language and framework is not going to cut it.
