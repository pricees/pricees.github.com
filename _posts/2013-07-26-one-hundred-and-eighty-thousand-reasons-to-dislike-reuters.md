### The Problem ###

I interviewed with Thomson Reuters for a position as a full-time Golang developer.  The contract paid $90/hr and was a 1+ year gig, giving it an annual value of somewhere around $180,000.00.  Whats more, it was 100% remote and, current, I am extremely keen on learning Google Go, so I was really gunning for it.  *I was awarded the position*.  I asked, and was allowed, to mull it over for a week.  *I accepted the offer*. The offer was rescinded without any communication.  And there was no further discussion with the hiring manager.  My perception of the situation is that either I was lied to by the hiring manager or Thomson Reuters doesn''t value professionalism in its hiring protocol.  Either way, I hope to warn other developers about this company and its shinanigans.  Let me clear my throat.

### The Meat and Potatoes ###

An hour after my technical interview -- Wednesday July 17, 2013 -- I was elated to receive this email:

  Hey Edward, I spoke with ******** and he liked you on the interview. So we want to move forward with hiring you. Let me know if you need to know anything more from us. Thanks

  This is great news.  I really enjoyed the interview, I even asked the questions to my coworkers.  What are the next steps to the hiring process? How soon could I begin?  Anything you want me to know or be thinking about for a potential day one?

  Best,
  Ted

  I'll need a w9, a NDA signed, and bank info for wire transfers (we don't mail checks only wires). Once we get those we can get you started whenever your ready.

I responded with exuberance: Google Go! 100% remote work!! Great money!!! Yeehaw!!!!  However, I wanted to wait for a few other companies to get back to me, with their offers, so I could hear them out.

This email thread was received while I was writing the one above:

  What kind of start date are you looking for?
</pre>

<pre>
  from: me

  Monday July 29th?  Does that sound reasonable.  I get back, tell my current company that I am out.  I wrap up any left over work and then start on Monday bright and early.

  Yeah that's fine, do you need more time to think about the offer ?
</pre>

By this time, it was the end of the work day.  I sent this response the following morning, after speaking with my brother about how to tactfully nagivate these waters.

  While I an leaning heavily towards Reuters, as a matter of professional courtesy, I told another firm I would listen to their offer.  Have a great week.  I will have limited email access for the next few days.

After receiving the offers from other companies, I decided to go with Reuters.  Sounds like a bad ass gig, right?  I sent an email formally accepting the offer.   I attached the NDA, my W9 and wire transfer information.  I was all set, or so I thought; I mean, this was Tuesday July 23rd, the date we had agreed to, so I was good right?  I hadn''t heard back in some time; however, it was after 5pm east coast... so... maybe he just shuts down right at 5... who knows?  The next morning I sent a follow up email around 11:00am east coast time.

<pre>

  Hey XXXXXX --
    I sent over the documents yesterday, shortly after 5pm ET.  I must respond to the remaining offers today.  Please let me know if we are good to move forward with the contract.  Thank you for your patience with this matter.  I am rather excited to be working on the project.

Here is the response.  One nondescript sentence from an iphone.

<pre>
Just got your emails. Unfortunately we are not going to be able to move forward.

What?!  Excuse me?! What the blip?!  O M G W T F!!!! I was so!! What? How could! Shocked!!  I was so flabbergasted that I couldn''t use my right pinky to shift, I had to use the left pinky.  The left.  Pinky.

  XXXXXX --

  I thought you told me that Tuesday was acceptable?

I haven''t received any further communication.  I am befuddled as to what happened.  I fired an email off to Reuters HR.  They are going to handle the matter internally.

<pre>
To Whom --
  My name is Edward Price, and I was recently interviewed and offered the job as a software developer/contractor.  I was given the offer last Wednesday. Excited as I was about the offer, out of professional courtesy to the other companies I was interviewing with, I asked if I could give my decision Tuesday.  The hiring manager agreed that Tuesday was an acceptable deadline.
    I did, in fact, accept the offer, yesterday, and didn't hear back from him.  I sent my Thomson Reuters NDA, a W9, and my bank account information.  I emailed this morning as to whether he had received my W9, NDA, and wiring info.  The response, I received, was blunt, cold and unprofessional:

    XXXXXXXXXX@thomsonreuters.com:
    "Just got your emails. Unfortunately we are not going to be able to move forward.

    Sent from my iPhone"

    Having been offered the job, and accepted with the time frame that we had agreed to, I asked why the offer was rescinded.  I have yet to hear back.  I have moved on from the initial shock that the job is no longer available.  Furthermore, given this experience, I am not certain this is the type of person I would want to work with.
      In closing, I cannot tell whether I am writing because I feel I was wronged and would like an apology, or whether I am just shocked that a global brand would treat a potential employee, one that was given an offer, with such disrespect.  I am befuddled.  What happened?
        I am not looking for any retribution, so I won't be giving out his name; however, it may be worth forwarding to HR so that they can discuss "tact" and the hiring process.
</pre>

I did not use the hiring managers name, nor will I.  This isn''t about getting him fired.  What it is about is treating individuals as human beings: with dignity, respect and a little professionalism.

Thomson Reuters, and I suspect many companies, might consider **retraining all hiring managers**.  I can tell you one thing: I will never interview for Reuters again, ever.

### Conclusion ###

What shocks me is that a global brand like Thomson Reuters would employ someone with that kind of unprofessionalism.  That employee has the power to hire and fire people.  That this employee would extend a lucrative offer on behalf of Thomson Reuters, and then turn around and act like a turkey.  Who knows what the circumstances could have been?  Another developer may be banking on that contract for her family, or something truly important -- I personally wanted to purchase an indoor hot tub with the monies).  This Reuters employee... I just don''t know what to say...   I am simply, as I wrote, befuddled.  Oh well.

Look, I can''t always have my way.  It''s not Ted''s world.  And that is fine.  I will dust myself off.  I will live to code another day.  Though maybe not in Go.  Just yet.  Until I can convince my new employer to rebuild its Rails app in Go!

I digress.

In this case, I had options.  I am so very grateful that I had other options that were perfectly acceptable to me, and more appropriate for my career path.

Money comes and goes.

Remote work is here to stay, if you want it.

And [Google Go](http://golang.org/) is going to be a force to reckon with if I have [my say about it](http://www.meetup.com/ChicaGoLang/), peep [my google community](https://plus.google.com/communities/100255370301493985490).
