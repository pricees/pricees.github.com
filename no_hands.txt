In Regards to AWS, its this simple:
  If your employees are running scripts against your production box OR
  If your employees are even thinking about shelling into your production box OR
  If monitoring software may restart custom services on your production BOX or
  If you are having to manually jobs against your production box

  You ain't doing it right.

Provisioning and Deployment

  


Provisioning Pipeline

  For each of yours apps:
  - Run Sprinkle (devops) scripts, build server for "app"to minimum specs.  
  - Create image, call it: "[app_name].[version].bare"

  Here is my simple deployment pipeline:

  - Deploy minimum requires onto "image_1.naked" to load application 
  - Create image, call it: "app_name.v1.image_1"

Image and/or User Data
