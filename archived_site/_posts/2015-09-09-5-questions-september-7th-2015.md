Every once in a while I am going to ask myself five questions that I either don't know or kinda know, but have taken for granted, and answer them here.

This weeks five questions are:

- Bash alternatives, pros and cons? 
- Docker alternatives pros and cons? 
- Where are the internet trunks in the world? 
- What are the types of orbits, their uses and heights? 
- How is coffee made?

### Bash Alternatives ###

The only bash alternative that has ever been mentioned to me is zsh (z shell).
I will let [these slides](http://www.slideshare.net/jaguardesignstudio/why-zsh-is-cooler-than-your-shell-16194692) and this [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1csl7c/bash_vs_zsh/) make the arguments.

### Docker alternatives, pros and cons ###

I found a honey of a video here about [Rocket and its difference to docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJKkjoLyw0g)

Here is an article on [LXC vs Docker vs Rocket](https://sreeninet.wordpress.com/2015/02/02/containers-docker-lxc-and-rocket/)

### Where are the internet trunks in the world? ###

The short answer is: all over the globe (except Africa :( ). 

What's really interesting is that the internet is chopped into 3 unofficial tiers of internet service providers:

- Tier 1: A network is one that can reach every other network on the Internet without purchasing IP transit or paying settlements.
- Tier 2: A network that peers with some networks, but still purchases IP transit or pays settlements to reach at least some portion of the Internet.
- Tier 3: A network that solely purchases transit from other networks to reach the Internet.

You can find a list of [tier 1 (backbone) providers on this forum](http://superuser.com/questions/399300/who-provides-the-internet-service-to-internet-service-providers-isps)

Respective trunks can be looked up by provider by using the googler. Here is the UUNET US Internet Backbone. ![image of UUNET Global Internet Backbone](http://www.1stnation.com/images/tour/map-02.jpg)

### Whats types of orbit are there? ###

[There are many orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_orbits) but I was looking for [Geocentric Orbit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit)

In short there are three orbits:

- Low Earth Orbit (LEO) 100-1200 miles above sea level. At 100 mi, orbit takes 90 minutes. e.g. These are scientific satellites.
- Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) 1200-22,236 miles above sea level (geosynchronous orbit), e.g. communications satellites.
- High Earth Orbit / Geosynchronous Orbit (HEO) 22,236 mi, orbit takes about a day (23h 56m 4.09s), e.g. global communication satellites and large scale phenomenon (hurricanes).

### How is coffee made? ###

Read this: [Ten Steps to Coffee: Seed to Cup](http://www.ncausa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=69)

It's a very long, manual process. One that should not end with the phrase "Folgers in your cup." Alas it goes something like this:

Coffee trees are planted. A new coffee tree takek about 3-4 years to produce cherries. Coffee cherries are harvested. This is usually manual labor that affords more care to pick better cherries. A good cherry picker can harvest 100-200 pounds of cherries a day, producing 30-40 lbs of beans.
Cherries are dried using dry or wet methods. The dry method is to lay the beans out on a huge surface and sun dry them. The wet method is more involved, removing the pulp and then dried. The beans are then milled, polished and sorted by size and weight.
Beans are green, called "green coffee," when exported in sacks to their final regions/locales. When they reach their final regions/locales they are "tasted" for quality. After meeting some kind of standard they are roasted, ground, and brewed.

Definitely read the article about tasting the coffee, its wild.
